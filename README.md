This repository contains a brief tutorial inspired by the paper "[Wasserstein Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01558.pdf)" by Tolstikhin, Bousquet, Gelly & Sch√∂lkopf (2017)

In this tutorial, we compare model frameworks for the generative adversarial network (GAN) formulation of the Wasserstein auto-encoder (WAEgan), the basic non-stochastic auto-encoder (AE), and the variational auto-encoder (VAE). To accomplish this, we implement each model in PyTorch as a convolutional auto-encoder similar to the popular DCGAN model and compare results with the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets.
